    "### Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection method is a simple numerical technique to find a root of a continuous function in an interval where this function changes sign. According to [Intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem), the continuous function $f=f(x)$ has at least one root in the interval $[a, b]$, if $f(a)f(b) \\leq 0$. Utilising this fact, the following 3-step algorithm will find the root of such function within a desired accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the midpoint $c = (a+b)/2$ and evaluate the function at this point $f(c)$.\n",
    "2. If $ (b-a)/2 < \\epsilon_1 $ or $|f(c)| < \\epsilon_2 $, then return $c$ as the root and stop. \n",
    "3. Otherwise, depending on the sign of $f(c)$ replace either $a$ or $b$ with $c$, such that $f(a)f(b) < 0$ for the new $a$ and $b$. Then go to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The criteria introduced in step 2 ensures the difference between the answer and the real root to be less than $\\epsilon_1$ or _that_ the function value at the answer is smaller than $\\epsilon_2$ (so it can be considered an approximate root). You are supposed to write a function that takes $a$, $b$, $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ as inputs and returns a root using the bisection method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the bisection method does not guarantee or detect a change of sign in an interval if the two end points have similar signs. Hence, your program should first search for some subinterval where the function changes sign. This can be achieved by halving the intervals consecutively until in one of the smaller subinterval the function changes sign. If no such an interval is found while the size of the smallest interval is still bigger than $\\epsilon_1$, the function returns 'None' and prints out \"failed to find a root\". \n",

    "For this task, you will work on a model of road traffic using discretised cells, which is an example of a larger class of models in computer science called [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). Imagine a road that is divided into a number of cells which can contain only one car. For now, let's assume this road is one-way from left to right. We also discretise time into steps. At each step a car moves to its adjacent right cell if it is empty; otherwise, it stays where it is (see the figure below). \n",

    "You should write a function that finds the position of cars in the next step given their positions in the current step. To do this systematically, we can define the numpy array `R[i,t]` that is 0 if there are no cars in the \"`i`\" section of the road, and 1 if a car is present at that section for the time step \"`t`\". \"`i`\" varies from 1 to $N$ (the total number of cells), and \"`t`\" varies from 0 to $T$. The new value `R[i,t+1]` depends on its old value at time $t$ (i.e. `R[i,t]`), and also on the old values of the neighbours (`R[i-1,t]` and `R[i+1,t]`). You might think about how you would fill out the tables below (on paper - no need to edit the table in your file) to use them to get an explicit form of the update rules (note we use notation here that `R[i,t]` is the same as $R^t(i)$ below):\n",

    "Storing `R[i,t]` at each time step is unnecessarily memory-consuming. Moreover, it is hard to track individual cars through the zeros and ones of `R[i,t]`. Instead, it is more efficient for many purposes to store the trajectories of each car in an array, `Traj[car,t]`, where each row records the trajectory for a different car, with the value in each successive column recording the location at each successive time step. Our next purpose is to use this array to calculate the average velocities of each car. So it is now better not to use the periodic boundary condition immediately, but to store the value of $N+1$ for the car that moves off the last cell (similarly storing the value of $N+2$ instead of 2 etc). For instance, for the 9-cell road shown in the previous figure `Traj` is constructed as below:\n",

Now write a new funtion **`new_position(r,Traj)`** that takes the vector `r` and the current position vector `Traj[:,t]`, and returns the next column `Traj[:,t+1]`. \n",
